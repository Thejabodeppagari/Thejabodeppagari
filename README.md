👋 Hi, I’m @Thejabodeppagari

🌱 I’m a fresher in the field of data science, passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. I've recently completed my studies and am excited to kickstart my career journey in this dynamic field.

🔍 I’m interested in exploring diverse domains within data science, from machine learning and data analysis to data visualization and AI.

📚 I’m well-versed in various data science tools and techniques, including SQL, Tableau, Python, and Power BI. I've worked on a project that focused on medical inventory optimization. This project involved applying data analysis and machine learning methods to enhance the management of medical supplies, aiming to minimize waste and enhance operational efficiency.

💼 I have also completed an internship in pulp processing manufacturing, gaining hands-on experience in data collection, analysis, and interpretation relevant to the manufacturing process.

🚀 Additionally, I've worked on an intriguing project centered around egg segmentation in the poultry industry. By harnessing computer vision and AI techniques, I successfully developed a solution to detect and differentiate between brown and white eggs. This project underscored my skills in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

🤝 I'm eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts on exciting data science projects and contribute to innovative solutions.

🔎 I am currently actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge. Whether it's an internship, entry-level position, or freelance project, I'm ready to contribute and learn in a professional environment.
